## Introduction {#sec-intro}

We can can include regular single-paper citations using `[@citation]` like [@Allenby:1998] or multiple-paper citations using `[@citation; @citation]` like [@Allenby:1998; @Watanabe:2010], in-line citations using `@citation` like @Allenby:1998, or citations without the Author using `[-@citation]` like [-@Allenby:1998].

Additionally, each section and sub-section can be referenced by adding a `{#sec-label}` label to any heading and referencing `@sec-label`. For example, `## Introduction {#sec-intro}` would be referenced as `@sec-intro` like @sec-intro (note that the `seg-` prefix is required).

## Model Specification {#sec-model}

We can include math using LaTeX within the `$` or `$$` syntax. For example, `$y = \beta x + \epsilon$` produces $y = \beta x + \epsilon$ and
$$
Pr(y_{n,h}=p|\beta_n) = \frac{\exp{(x_{p,h}'\beta_n)}}{\sum_{p=1}^P\exp{(x_{p,h}'\beta_n)}}
$$ {#eq-mnl}

\noindent is produced using the `$$` syntax. The equation has to be labeled with `{#eq-label}` directly following the closing `$$` so it can be referenced with `@eq-label`. For example, the above equation `{#eq-mnl}` would be referenced as `@eq-mnl` like @eq-mnl (note that the `eq-` prefix is required).

## Empirical Application {#sec-data}

Using Quarto means we can use Markdown, Python, and LaTeX (along with other languages) interchangeably.

We can include tables and figures. If Markdown `![]()` syntax is used to include figures, the label would be `{#fig-slug}` and the figure would be referenced with `@fig-slug` (note that the `fig-` prefix is required).

## Results {#sec-results}

Our tables and figures can be dynamically generated.

## Conclusion {#sec-concl}

One final note. While the bibliography will be placed automatically at the end of the paper, we may have a few additional citations like R packages and other software to include that aren't explicitly cited elsewhere that we can include using the LaTeX syntax `\nocite{author:year, author:year}` (since we are using `natbib` for citations) as is demonstrated in the following bibliography.

\nocite{bayesm:2018, loo:2018}
